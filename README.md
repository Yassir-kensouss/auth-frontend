# Front end of the authentication system app

This repository containing all the necessary pages for an auth system :
  1. Landing Page
  2. Register Page
  3. Login Page
  4. Profile Page

The whole application was built with **styled-component** in order to provide a structured code, which means every page has it's own unique styling in a seperate .js file, furthermore styled-component generates the css vendor prefixes which is important to get a full **browser compatibility**.

The application is consuming a REST Api which I built using Node JS and it's framework Express JS ofcourse with the help of some packages such as **Jsonwebtoken, express-jwt, express-validator

!! This template is not responsive yet it's recommanded to run it in a desktop view

So That's it all you have to do is to clone this repo and run an npm i :)
